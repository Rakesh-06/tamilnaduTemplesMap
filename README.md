OMG!!! really the toughest of all....... a Real chanllenge in this Front-End Wed developer course.


### Concept:

######    One of the most fabulous tourism heritage of INDIA is the Temples here. And its very much true with Tamilnadu. One main tourism theme of Tamilnadu. there are a lot of Temples which have a great history behind it and something special and soulful. I listed 10 most famous, relatively large and popularly known Temples of TamilNadu (My home). These places not only giving a spiritual, religious faith to all. It has something more than it. A Peace. Most of the Temples have a legendary history according to Tamilnadu's people. These temples have a greater history and a fabulous historical architecture.If one travels to TamilNadu He/She should never miss to visit the temples here at any cost.

##### To all the developers who will be a part of this in future......... do it will your fullest efforts and use the internet to the critical point you know..... use stackoverflow, googel developers documentations, course tutorials, instruction links everything.......And also Save Some time with the initial projcets.... that could help you here...............


### INSTALL and RUN

  THis code base will be available in the Github. go the Repo (https://rakesh-06.github.io/tamilnaduTemplesMap/) and download the zip file extract it and reun the **index.html** in your browser. Also get through the java script and css files.....


### Libraries used :

    For this project we use jquery library and can also use css bootstrap. its really important use the organisational library KNOKOUT.JS for this project that uses a MVVM concept.
    Create index.html, styles.css and main.js for the implementations along with these Libraries.

### Requirement

    To complete this porject, first we need a google maps **API KEY** to access various features of the google maps. Visit (https://console.developers.google.com) to enable **API KEY**.
    Also we need to use a 3rd party API to get resources about the places.
    WIKIPEDIA can be used as a 3rd party that doesnt need an *API KEY* or a *SECURE ID*.


### MY WORk

    I listed-out **10 Temples** amoung the most famous temples of TamilNadu. These gives a __religious, spiritual, architectural and the history of the GODS, those places and their people.__

    Added features like * a nicely styled Map* with animations like *Marker drop, marker changing color, marker bounces when clicked, the infowindow that open has got a link about the temples to the wikipedia resource*. and a nice *StreetView* of that Temple if available.This site is also made responsive. Also added error handlers to put out error messages when the request fails. This site is simple but got a lot of information and Peace.......
    Used Online compressor website Optimizilla to compress the image. Use online minifiers to minify css and javascript files. inline css in html for better performance.


### My sincere Gratitude

    I'm thankful the Udacity for enlighting my knowledge in F-END. the Additional lessons about the GOOGLE API was very much helful. [Google developers doumentations](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) adied a lot for the progress. All the instrution notes, references in [Stackoverflow](www.Stackoverflow.com), Udacity Discussion Forum and the discussions in the *SLACK CHANNEL* from other F_END developers of saame level helped a lot to workout with the project.
